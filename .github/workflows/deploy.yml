# Only trigger on main branch pull request close events
# used to deploy code after merging
# Versioning is automatically generated when merging, this is created by detecting the branch prefix:
# - 'major' prefix for major release (e.g. N.x.x)
# - 'minor' or 'feature' prefix for minor release (e.g. x.N.x)
# - 'patch' or 'bugfix' prefix for patch release (e.g. x.x.N)
# - no prefix for prepatch release (e.g. x.x.x-N)
